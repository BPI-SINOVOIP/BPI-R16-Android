# Build Skia with Address Sanitizer.
#
# Address Sanitizer is available in LLVM (and Clang) 3.1 and above, as well as
# GCC 4.8.  For now, this script assumes the use of Clang 3.2 or newer, which
# uses different flag syntax from 3.1.
#
# For more information, see:
# https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer
